This simulator allows you to model the evolution of a monthly invested capital with a given interest rate, and thus better understand the impact of time and regularity on a savings or investment approach.

The user can easily customize three main parameters in the code:

the amount saved each month,
the annual interest rate,
the investment term (in years).
Once this data is entered, the program automatically calculates the monthly growth of the capital. At the end of the simulation, it displays the total capital obtained after the specified period and generates a graph showing the capital's growth over time.

This program uses a single external library: matplotlib, which is used to plot the curve representing the evolution of capital. If it is not installed, simply run the following command: %pip install matplotlib

The code can be used in environments such as Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook, Spyder, or any Python editor compatible with graphics. It does not require a database connection or complex configuration.

We chose to develop this program with the aim of providing a simple and accessible tool to better understand the mechanisms of long-term savings and investment. It is primarily aimed at people who want to plan their financial future, whether they are individuals wishing to save regularly or students looking to visualize the impact of compound interest.
